Level 4
#
 The solution to this level is located in the original folder, where it all began, more precisely in the "level" folder, which contains a text file that we do not have permission to read. That's why we will use the command "chmod u+rw."
#
cd /
	ls 
 
	cd level
 
	cd 04_kwisatz
 
	ls -al
 
	cat README.txt

 chmod u+rw README2.md

 cat README2.md
