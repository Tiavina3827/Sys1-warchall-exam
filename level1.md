 du -b -a : The command "du -b -a" is used to display the size of all files and directories in the specified directory, including hidden files. The "-b" option instructs the "du" command to display sizes in bytes, while the "-a" option asks it to include the sizes of all files, including hidden files starting with a dot. This can be useful for getting an overview of the disk space used by all files, including those that are normally hidden.
It show to us the way to SOLUTION.txt
